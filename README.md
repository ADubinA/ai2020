TODO  06/11/19:
1. Add a travel time function that will be used by all agents.
2. Add a score evaluation once all agents were terminated.
3. Break ties in a consistent way.
4. Add a slightly more robust graph.
5. Test the s*** out of it.

TODO 06/11/19
6. IMPORTANT: Ask if we need to solve destroyer/helpful agents interaction -> meaning that if a road the greedy agent was going to use is destroyed by the annihilator, the greedy agent should terminate.

7. IMPORTANT: Have the greedy save the whole path rather than re-calculate at every node.
